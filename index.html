      <h1>COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF LOGO LANE IN MOBILE LEGENDS</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h1>EXP LANE</h1>
      <h3>Lane logo Exp Lane in Mobile Legends (ML) it is marked in the shape of the letter E, for its location it often changes with Gold Lane. But what distinguishes these two lanes is the position Turtles first time present.</h3>
      <h3>Exp Lane will be determined on the lane closest to Turtle. Likewise with the opponent. Unlike Dota 2 which Offlaners oppose Safelaner, instead in Mobile Legends, Offlaners will fight Offlaners, Safelaners against Safelaners.</h3>
      <h3>As an Exp Lane, the thing that takes precedence is the skill level of the hero. Heroes in the Exp Lane aim to get a high level. The reason is their very good skills helping teammates.</h3>
      <h3>There are two ways to get Exp, namely by killing Turtle or killing Siege Minion. Turtle will give a buff to the last hitter and also Exp to friends around him who help beat Turtle.</h3>
      <h3>Meanwhile, the Siege Minion that the writer mentioned is a Siege Minion carrying something behind him. If you're on the Exp Lane, Siege Minion will bring a roll of files that can increase EXP 50%.</h3>
      <h3>For heroes that fit this lane are thick and sick heroes like Role Fighter and Tank. The example is Balmond, Alucard, Zilong, Bane, and Terizla.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content1">
      <h1>JUNGLING</h1>
      <h3>Logos Jungling marked with a logo that is between the two lanes. The position of the logo is also in the forest or what is called the Jungle.</h3>
      <h3>Jungling or jungler is a position that is no less crucial. He must be able to kill the jungle creeps to get buff, Gold, and Exp. To speed up, usually assisted with a spell Retribution.</h3>
      <h3>So, the task of a Jungler is to reach a level and get Gold as fast as possible. In Dota 2, a role similar to this is carry. He will carry one team so that his team can win.</h3>
      <h3>If you ask what type of hero is often used as a jungler, the results vary. Most normally, heroes who occupy this position are heroes with roles Assassins. However, there are also those who use Marksman or Fighters.</h3>
      <h3>An example of a hero included as a Jungler hero is Fanny, Gusion, Lancelot, Alucard, Martis, and Zilong.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content2">
      <h1>MIDLANE</h1>
      <h3>The Midlane logo is a logo that is always in the same location, namely in the middle of the map. The logo is marked with a diagonal line which indicates the Mid Lane of the two teams.</h3>
      <h3>In Mobile Legends (ML), Midlaner including as a very crucial position. The reason is, heroes who are in this lane must be able to do two things: clear minion wave quickly and help around.</h3>
      <h3>However, if the midlaner's first tower is destroyed, he will start to lose the ability to control the map from the middle. Makes it difficult for you to rotate to each lane. Not only that, the enemy can control some of your jungle creeps that are close to the mid lane.</h3>
      <h3>The job of a midlaner is not easy. Therefore, usually a midlaner is filled by the Mage role with the reason that the burst damage is capable of clearing minion waves quickly. Just say it Parsha, Nana, Gord, Xavier, and Chang'e.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content3">
      <h1>GOLD LINE</h1>>
      <h3>It is the opposite of the Exp Lane. Gold Lane marked with a logo shaped like $. Or, you can also see Turtle's position, because Gold Lane's position is farthest from Turtle's position.</h3>
      <h3>As a Gold Laner, your real job is to find as much gold as possible. The reason is that Gold Lane heroes prioritize basic attacks or skills with fast cooldowns.</h3>
      <h3>There are two ways you can do to get gold: namely kill Creep Jungle Crab and kill Siege Minions.</h3>
      <h3>Start with Crab. The position is very close to your lane. Anyone who can kill Crab will get a Gold Buff, which is a buff that can provide extra gold.</h3>
      <h3>With this gold, you can buy items more quickly. The faster you build sick items at the start of the game, the easier it will be for you to conquer the game.</h3>
      <h3>For heroes who occupy this lane, the dominant ones come from role Marksman. Examples like Mia, Lesley, Claude, and Wanwan.</h3>
